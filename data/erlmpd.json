    "intro": "Just a short notice to announce the uploading of erlmpd to Github. This module implements the [MPD protocol](http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/) in Erlang and was developed for a web-based MPD client I'm currently working on. Since I felt this module could potentially stand on its own two feet, I've released the source code [here](http://github.com/caolan/erlmpd/tree/master). I've also uploaded the [docs](/docs/erlmpd.html) for reference.",

Pretty handy for collaboratively creating playlists or controling playback wirelessly.\n"
