The answer seems to be an undocumented feature of writeHead, that\nallows you to pass an array of headers instead. 'Use an array' is a little\nambiguous, so let me provide an example:\n\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">res.writeHead(200, [\n    ['Set-Cookie', 'mycookie1=value1'],\n    ['Set-Cookie', 'mycookie2=value2']\n]);</code></pre>\n\nSimple enough. Another option is to attempt to combine multiple cookie\nkey-value pairs in one Set-Cookie header, but in practice you'll be running\ninto more browser incompatibilities this way.\n\nThere is, however, one important issue with this feature. __If you author any\nmiddleware__ for Connect or any other frameworks, and you proxy calls to\nwriteHead or modify headers in any other way, __you need to support headers as\nan array!__ This change seemed to have passed me by, so I thought I'd spread\nthe word a little."
